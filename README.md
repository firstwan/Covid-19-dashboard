# Covid 19 dashboard
Hi all, this is my first Dash project.
I build this project only to practice data analysis and gain some experience on Dash project.

The dataset I used for this project is provided by Our World in Data. You can get the data from [here](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data).

## How to run this project
1. Create virtual environment for Python
    ```
    cd src
    pipenv shell
    ```

2. Install all the dependency on this project
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run this command to start the Dash app
    ```
    python app.py
    ```
